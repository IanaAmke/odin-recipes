    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is one of my favourite recipes! Pilau is basically rice that has been cooked with a mix of spices generally referred to as <i>pilau masala</i>. It is pretty versatile as you can add any meat or vegetables to the rice and the rice is usually served
        with a basic salad called <i>kachumbari</i> that is made up of onions, tomatoes, lemon juice, and coriander leaves.</p>
