    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>This is one of my favourite recipes! Pilau is basically rice that has been cooked with a mix of spices generally referred to as <i>pilau masala</i>. It is pretty versatile as you can add any meat or vegetables to the rice and the rice is usually served
        with a salad called <i>kachumbari</i> that is made up of onions, tomatoes, lemon juice, and coriander leaves.</p>

    <p>In Kenya, pilau was mostly associated with the Coastal region, which has a strong Arab/Persian influence due to the trading that happened during the colonial era. It is assumed that the spices were introduced to this region then. However, the people
        made pilau their own therefore it is quite different compared to pilau found in other parts of the world e.g. in India.</p>

    <p>Okay, so let's get to it, shall we?</p>
